        <p>Basketball is a really fun game.It is my favorite hobby because it keeps me active and is very fun to play. I like playing on basketball teams and just for fun at my school. It is a very popular sport worldwide, played with a round and usually orange (orange-brown) ball that bounces. Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling, shooting, running, and jumping. Each made basket is worth two points, while a basket made from beyond the three-point line is worth three points.</p>
